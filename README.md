# Learn Functional Programming

This is a collection of exercises to accompany a half-day workshop on the basics of functional programming.

**NOTE:** This is not a way to learn hardcore, mathematically correct “functional programming”. This is a collection of exercises to help teach common functional programming techniques that will make your code easier to debug and maintain, regardless of whether or not you have any idea [what the fuck a monad is](https://git.io/vyzvq).

## Quickstart

```sh
# Clone the exercises
git clone https://github.com/jlengstorf/learn-fp-exercises.git

# Move into the exercise directory
cd learn-fp-exercises/

# Open the first exercise
open exercises/01-map-simple.html
```

In your favorite code editor, open the JavaScript for the exercise (`src/01-map-simple.js`), read the instructions, and refactor away!

If you get stuck, the refactored code is available in `src/solutions/`. This isn’t a test, so don’t feel guilty if you need to see a solution to finish a given exercise. However, **please actually write the code for each solution by hand — typing things out helps them stick.**
